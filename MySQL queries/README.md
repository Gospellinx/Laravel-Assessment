SQL Query Challenge - E-commerce Database
This README provides an explanation for the SQL queries that were written to analyze an e-commerce database, consisting of two tables: orders and order_items.

Database Tables
1. orders Table
Column	Type	Description
id	INT	Unique identifier for the order
user_id	INT	ID of the user who placed the order
total_amount	DECIMAL	Total amount for the order
created_at	DATETIME	Date and time when the order was created
2. order_items Table
Column	Type	Description
id	INT	Unique identifier for the order item
order_id	INT	ID of the associated order
product_id	INT	ID of the product in the order
quantity	INT	Quantity of the product ordered
price	DECIMAL	Price of the product at the time of purchase
SQL Queries and Results
1️⃣ Retrieve the Top 5 Customers with the Highest Total Spending
SQL Query:

sql
Copy
SELECT u.id, u.name, SUM(o.total_amount) AS total_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN users u ON o.user_id = u.id
GROUP BY u.id, u.name
ORDER BY total_spent DESC
LIMIT 5;
Explanation:

This query retrieves the top 5 customers based on their total spending.
We join the orders table with the users table to get the customer details, then sum up the total_amount for each customer.
The result is ordered by total spending in descending order, and we limit the output to the top 5 customers.
Result Example:

id	name	total_spent
1	John Doe	1500.00
2	Jane Smith	1200.50
3	Alice Johnson	950.75
4	Bob Brown	850.25
5	Charlie White	720.40
2️⃣ Get the Total Revenue for the Current Month
SQL Query:

sql
Copy
SELECT SUM(total_amount) AS total_revenue
FROM orders
WHERE MONTH(created_at) = MONTH(CURRENT_DATE())
AND YEAR(created_at) = YEAR(CURRENT_DATE());
Explanation:

This query calculates the total revenue generated by all orders placed in the current month.
It filters the orders based on the current month and year using the created_at timestamp.
Finally, it sums up the total_amount column to give the total revenue for the month.
Result Example:

total_revenue
23500.75
3️⃣ List the Most Sold Products
SQL Query:

sql
Copy
SELECT p.id, p.name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC;
Explanation:

This query identifies the most sold products by calculating the total quantity sold for each product.
We join the order_items table with the products table to get product details, then sum up the quantity column.
The result is ordered by total sold in descending order (most sold products first).
Result Example:

id	name	total_sold
101	Product A	500
102	Product B	450
103	Product C	400
104	Product D	375
105	Product E	350
⚡ Bonus: Get the Top 5 Most Sold Products
SQL Query:

sql
Copy
SELECT p.id, p.name, SUM(oi.quantity) AS total_sold
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.id
GROUP BY p.id, p.name
ORDER BY total_sold DESC
LIMIT 5;
Explanation:

This query is a variation of the previous query, but it is limited to the top 5 most sold products.
It performs the same operation as the previous query but limits the output to the top 5 based on the total sold quantity.
Result Example:

id	name	total_sold
101	Product A	500
102	Product B	450
103	Product C	400
104	Product D	375
105	Product E	350
Conclusion
These SQL queries help analyze sales data from an e-commerce platform. By calculating total revenue, identifying top customers, and finding the most popular products, businesses can gain valuable insights to improve operations and marketing strategies.

Optimizations
The queries are optimized to work efficiently by joining only the necessary tables and filtering data based on conditions (e.g., current month).
Use of SUM() and GROUP BY allows aggregating data and returning useful statistics.
